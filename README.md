# pythonForDataAnalytics
In this repo i will upload 100 practice question for python basically i am doing a python practice easy to advance and more even harder, the goal is to be prepare for the data science or Machine Learning, i will do my best until i achieve and the rest i will left in the hand of God!

Questions which i solved:
  Easy (25 questions) – Basics, logic, loops, functions, data structures
  Medium (25 questions) – Algorithms, OOP, file handling, intermediate logic
  Hard (25 questions) – Advanced algorithms, decorators, generators, APIs, and regex
  Hardest Ever (25 questions) – Deep Python concepts, optimization, concurrency, and system-level challenges
